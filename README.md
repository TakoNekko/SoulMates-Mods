# Soul Mates mods

A small patch to allow text scaling in the demo of the video game **Soul Mates** ([Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2279440/Soul_Mates/)).

See [Closed Issues](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) for a detailed list of every changes.

## Notes
The demo and full game will probably get patched later to add proper built-in text scaling.

## How to play
1. Download the latest version of the mod from the [releases](../../releases) page
2. Extract the zip file into the root folder of the game. (If all done correctly, you should now have a `\Soul Mates Demo\BepInEx\plugins\BepInEx5Plugins.Ash.SoulMates.TextScaling\` subfolder)
3. Start the game

*Press `F1` while in-game to adjust text scaling values.*

## How to compile (for developers)
1. Copy the `Managed` folder from `Soul Mates Demo/Soul Mates_Data` to the solution's `lib` folder
2. Compile
